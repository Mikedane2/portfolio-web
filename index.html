           <div class="para" id="intro">Becoming a software engineer is often seen as a path filled with formal education, structured courses, and prestigious degrees. However, my journey into the world of software development was quite different. As a self-taught software engineer, I've embarked on a unique and challenging adventure, acquiring knowledge and skills through independent learning and personal projects. In this article, I'll share my journey and showcase three intermediate projects that demonstrate my growth as a self-taught software engineer.

            <div class="para" id="project1" >Project 1: Personal Portfolio Website
                When I first started my self-taught journey, my primary goal was to create a personal portfolio website.
                 I wanted a platform to showcase my skills and projects, even though I was just beginning.
                 Over time, I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building the foundation for my site.
                As I progressed, I integrated responsive design principles, added interactive elements,
                and optimized it for performance.
                 This project was my starting point and marked my transition from a beginner to an intermediate developer.

            <div class="para" id="project2" >
                Project 2: Task Management Application
             Once I gained confidence with the basics, I decided to tackle a more complex project: a task management application.
              This project pushed me to learn more about web development, databases, and backend programming.
               I built a full-stack application with features like user authentication, task creation, and status updates.
                Developing this application required a deep dive into technologies like Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and API development. 
                It also honed my problem-solving skills and understanding of software architecture.

             <div class="para" id="project3" >
                Project 3: E-commerce Website
                For my third intermediate project, 
                I took on a significant challenge: creating an e-commerce website.
                 This project demanded a wide range of skills, 
                 from designing the user interface to setting up secure payment processing. 
                 I used frameworks like React for the frontend, and Express and MongoDB for the backend.
                  Building this project taught me about complex data management, security best practices, 
                  and the importance of user experience. It was a testament to how much I had grown as a self-taught software engineer.

            <div class="para" id="conclution" >
                My journey as a self-taught software engineer has been a rewarding and transformative experience.
             Through dedication, countless hours of self-study, and the completion of these three intermediate projects, 
             I've not only honed my technical skills but also developed problem-solving abilities, project management expertise, 
             and a deep appreciation for the world of software development. 
             While the path of a self-taught engineer is challenging,
              the projects I've completed are a testament to the progress one can make with determination and a passion for learning. 
              As I continue my journey,
               I look forward to more complex projects and ongoing growth in the dynamic field of software engineering.
